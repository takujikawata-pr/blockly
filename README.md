## Installer
This software can work offline by installing it on your computer for [Windows (master branch)](https://github.com/OttoDIY/blockly).

You can [download the latest release from here](https://github.com/OttoDIY/blockly/releases). After the software is installed in your PC, it is ready to use immediately, you do not need to import Arduino libraries or any additional swtup for the boards because it comes with a copy of the Arduino CLI, it is all in one software!, you will be ready to upload codes directly to your robot or any other Arduino project via USB.

If your computer do not recognize the USB device or Otto, you have to [install the CH340 or CH341 or FTDI driver that is in the "driversUSB" folder](https://github.com/OttoDIY/blockly/tree/master/driversUSB) or [download from this link](https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/ch340.html)

## Help us add new Languages

Leave your mark in the world by translating Blockly for the world, you are welcome to contribute with any languages you know, it will benefit you and everyone in your community.

The more people helping to translate the better, it is important to translate while understanding the context and what is the robot actually doing to be accurate.

1. Go to [lang folder and duplicate the Arduino_en.js Blockly_en.js and msg_en.js  files from english](https://github.com/OttoDIY/blockly/tree/master/www/lang), 
2. Rename them according to your ISO language code, for example fr is for French,so the files are renamed like this: Arduino_fr.js Blockly_fr.js and msg_fr.js  
3. Edit the files with any code editor software like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) translating only the english part after = in between the quotes "" in visual studio is the text in red.
4. Then [pull a request here in github](https://github.com/OttoDIY/blockly/pulls) or just [attach the files in an new issue](https://github.com/OttoDIY/blockly/issues).
